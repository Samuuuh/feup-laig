## Project information

Our scene was inspired in the iron throne room of the series Game of Thrones

In addition, we added an extra primitive named HalfTorus to create better door. You can see the XML with this primitive [here](scenes/full-scene.xml).

- We have another primitive, one half torus.
- Code Documentation
- We made an effort to make modular code. For example, we have a function to parse descendants of the node and other functions to parse each leaf.
- We followed the week plan strictly 
- Scene
  - Iron throne
  - Stairs to the iron throne
  - Two torchs, each one with one light source
  - One window, with light source and some decoration around it
  - Flags of the House Targaryen, representing the current ruling house
  - You can see our scene [here](scenes/LAIG_TP1_XML_T1_G04_v02.xml.xml) (Without HalfTorus)
